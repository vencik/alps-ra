ALPS Input Devices Reverse Analysis Tools
=========================================

This small project was created to simplify the steps necessary to start
RA of devices controlled by the ALPS sub-driver of psmouse Linux driver.

Since ALPS Electric traditionally assumes dismissive position towards
any requests for technical documentation, writing driver for touchpads
and trackpoints they manufacture requires detailed reverse analysis
of the communication protocol.
At the time of writing this, no less than 6 different protocols are in use
for ALPS (dualpoint) touchpads.


Usage
-----

For simplicity and to save time, it's rather nice to compile the psmouse
driver with your changes out of the kernel tree to get a RA and debugging
driver.

You shall need your Linux kernel headers installed, the kernel source tarball
and the GNU gcc compiler and Linux kernel compilation tools, of course.
On Debian and its derivatives, the following should get you all you need for
kernel building (run as root):

----
# apt-get install linux-headers linux-source kernel-package fakeroot perl
----

The set_source.sh script extracts the psmouse driver and the ALPS sub-driver
documentation from supplied source tarball and creates a copy to enable
creation of kernel patch later.

----
$ ./set_source.sh /usr/src/linux-source-<version>.tar.xz
----

Directories ./a and ./b shall be created.
The psmouse driver Makefile in ./b/drivers/input/mouse/ directory is replaced
by out-of-tree version also containing a few RA-specific targets.

----
$ cd ./b/drivers/input/mouse
$ make help
----

The install_ra_hook and uninstall_a_hook targets will (attempt to) add/remove
one source line to.from alps.c, function alps_process_byte, that will include
a small amount of code used to dump the packets obtained from the device
to the kernel ring buffer.
The code shall be referenced as RA hook.

The RA hook installed to the sub-driver source may be configured in
Makefile.config file (sourced from Makefile).
By default, 6 byte packets are assumed.
The packets shall be dumped and further processing of the packets shan't
be done.

----
$ make instal_ra_hook
$ make
$ make load
----

The show_pkt target calls show_pkt.pl script used to grep the packets dump
from the kernel ring buffer and visualise them.
The script may also be used to test hypotheses and formulate packet decoding
routines (as was done for the protocol v6).

Typically, you touch the device, then check the packets produced:

----
$ make show_pkt
----

Then, formulate a hypothesis, implement its check in the show_pkt.pl script
and try again.
And again.
And again...

Be patient, the process tends to be quite teadious.

When you think you know what to do, implement the protocol decoding in
alps.[ch], allow processing of the packets in Makefile.config
and check the result:

----
$ make load
----

This HOWTO isn't a good place to explain how to implement the driver; read
the documentation in ./b/Documentation/input/alps.txt, and read the code.

If you are sucessfull, don't forget to document your findings in the text
file above and create and post a patch.
